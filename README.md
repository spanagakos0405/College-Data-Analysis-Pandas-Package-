# College-Data-Analysis-Pandas-Package-
This repository focuses on the analysis of college data. I took two datasets from Kaggle, cleaned them, and tried to see trends between different variables like out-of-state-tuition, in-state-tuition, early-career-pay, and mid-career-pay. These variables are all connected to the different colleges in the United States.
